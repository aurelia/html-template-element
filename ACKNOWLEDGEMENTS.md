# Acknowledgements

This html-template-element polyfill was forked and extracted from the Polymer TemplateBinding library [https://github.com/Polymer/TemplateBinding](https://github.com/Polymer/TemplateBinding). Much thanks goes to the authors of the original implementation. This version of the library has been slightly modified to make it consistent with Aurelia's overall design and to decouple it with the template binding behavior in the original library. Below is the required notice from the original library.
